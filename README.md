Indexing Improvement Proposals (IIPs) describe standards for indexing blockchains and blockchain applicationI

# Contributing

 1. Review [IIP-1](IIPs/iip-001.md).
 2. Fork the repository.
 3. Add your IIP to your fork of the repository. There is a [template IIP here](iip-template.md).
 4. Submit a Pull Request to Chain Agnostics's [IIPs repository](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/IIPs).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final IIP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new IIP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to` header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the IIP as a whole.

If your IIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that IIP as follows: `assets/iip-N` (where **N** is to be replaced with the IIP number). When linking to an image in the IIP, use relative links such as `../assets/iip-1/image.png`.
